    Myanmar. It is the second <strong>festival of lights</strong> marks the end of the rainy season as well as the
    Kahtein season. During the festival, we celebrate with many activities. There are both large festivities like
    Taunggyi Hot Air Balloon Festival and small festivities like firework launching competitions and some live
    performances to entertain us. We offer monks and monasteries alms and offerings as well as a tradition of Myanmar.

  <p class="text-white-50 text"> &nbsp;We celebrate Tazaungdaing to commemorate a story, in which Buddha's mother, Maya,
    is weaving yellow monk robes for Buddha during his renunciation. Buddha's aunt continued this tradition and offered
    new robes annually. We now carry on that tradition and celebrate festivals and release hot air balloons as an
    offering of light.</p>
