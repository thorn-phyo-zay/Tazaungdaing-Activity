  <p class="text">The Tazaungdaing Festival is celebrated in November as a national holiday in Myanmar. It is the second
    <strong>festival of lights</strong> marks the end of the rainy season as well as the Kahtein season. During the
    festival, we celebrate with many activities. There are both large festivities like Taunggyi Hot Air Balloon Festival
    and small festivities like firework launching competitions and some live performances to entertain us. We offer
    monks and monasteries alms and offerings as well as a tradition of Myanmar. The Tazaungdaing Festival can be
    considered an essential part of Burmese culture and history. </p>
